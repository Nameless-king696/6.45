        question: "1. Infants have the greatest body water content due to which of the following causes?",
        answers: {
            a: "They have high body fat.",
            b: "They have high mass of skeletal muscles.",
            c: "They have low body fat",
            d: "They have high bone mass."
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: "Infants have a higher percentage of total body water primarily because they have a relatively low body fat content compared to adults. Since fat tissue contains less water than other tissues, a lower fat percentage means a higher overall water percentage."

        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: "The Sodium ($Na^+$) concentration is highest in the Extracellular fluid and lowest in the intracellular fluid (ICF), due to the constant action of the Na/K pump, which actively pumps $Na^+$ out of the cell."
    },
    {

        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: "The correct order from largest to smallest volume is: Intracellular fluid (ICF) (largest), followed by Interstitial fluid (ISF), and finally Plasma (smallest)."
    },
    {
        question: "6. Various tissues in the body have different levels of water content. Which of the following tissues is having the lowest water content by volume?",
        answers: {
            a: "Liver",
            b: "Cardiac muscle",
            c: "Skeletal muscle",
            d: "Adipose tissue"
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: "Adipose tissue (fat) has the lowest percentage of water by volume compared to organs and muscle tissues, which are rich in water."
    },
    {
        question: "7. Negative feedback mechanisms return the disturbed variable to which of the following values?",
        answers: {
            a: "a value higher than the original value.",
            b: "a value lower than the original value.",
            c: "any value above or below the original one.",
            d: "its ideal value."
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: "Negative feedback aims to oppose the original change, working to restore the disturbed variable back to its ideal value (set point), thus maintaining homeostasis."
    },
    {
        question: "8. Which of the following statements describes transport of a substance by an active transport mechanism?",
        answers: {
            a: "downhill without a carrier.",
            b: "downhill using a carrier.",
            c: "enclosed inside a vesicle from outside the cell to its inside.",
            d: "uphill using a carrier and utilizing ATP."
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: "Active transport moves a substance 'uphill' (against its concentration gradient), requires a carrier protein, and demands an input of energy, typically from ATP (in primary active transport)."

            d: "filtration."
        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: "The movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane due to a difference in water concentration (or solute concentration) is specifically called osmosis."

            d: "secondary pumps."
        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: "Ions diffuse across the membrane passively (downhill) via highly selective protein channels, which form pores through the membrane."

        question: "11. Movement of water molecules from high concentration of water to low concentration of water is termed:",
        answers: {
            a: "facilitated diffusion.",
            b: "uniport.",
            c: "pinocytosis.",
            d: "osmosis."
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: "This describes the process of osmosis, which is the net diffusion of water across a membrane from an area of higher water concentration to an area of lower water concentration."

    {
        question: "12. A -ve feedback mechanism aims at decreasing the:",
        answers: {

            d: "return to the normal value of a changed variable."
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: "The function of a negative feedback mechanism is to counteract and reduce (decrease) the extent of the change of a variable in the internal environment, bringing the system back toward the set point (homeostasis)."
